## Notes
have undesirable items drop desireable items

grindstone is getting removed, but dungeon loot will be allowed to have enchantments. enchantments will be sort of a "lost art". 

runes only apply the shimmer they have

gemstones can be found in:
* cut emerald : diorite
* cut diamond: gabbro
* cut amethyst: dolomite, claystone
* cut lapis: marble, limestone
* cut opal: quartzite
* cut pyrite: phyllite, basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, shist, slate
* cut ruby: chert
* cut sapphire: chalk
* cut topaz:granite
