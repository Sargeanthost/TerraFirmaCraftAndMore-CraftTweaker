### TODO

replace minecraft woods with tag that includes minecraft woods and tfc woods

adjust loot from quark dungeons

use quern to grind down glowing ink sack into 12 glow stone powder

edit dungeon crawl loot table. https://github.com/xyroc/DungeonCrawl/tree/1.18.2/src/datagen/java/xiroc/dungeoncrawl/data/loot
I think the way to do this is by making a custom loot pool of things we want, clearing the loot pool from the chests, and then linking ours

check if we can change mob's armour and can hold, if not disable their drops

have undesirable items drop desireable items

change where frogs spawn? add nutrition and expiration date

remove stonecutter access in future version since cant use chisel easily now

make chains meltable

check firmalife recipes

edit terrafirma book with gemstone rarity (4%) and locations (below)

## Notes

The undermentioned need to be changed in biome settings
add back dungeons enhanced and structure gel, getting rid of villager spawning structures. adjust loot table as well. list of acceptable structures:
* dungeons_enhanced:castle
* dungeons_enhanced:deep_crypt
* dungeons_enhanced:desert_temple
* dungeons_enhanced:desert_tomb
* dungeons_enhanced:druid_circle
* dungeons_enhanced:dungeon_variant
* dungeons_enhanced:elders_temple
* dungeons_enhanced:flying_dutchman
* dungeons_enhanced:hay_storage
* dungeons_enhanced:ice_pit
* dungeons_enhanced:large_dungeon
* (dungeons_enhanced:monster_maze) dont want oak wood, can we change this? prevent sapling drop perhaps
* dungeons_enhanced:mushroom_house
* dungeons_enhanced:ruined_building
* dungeons_enhanced:stables make this really low chance to spawn
* dungeons_enhanced:sunken_shrine adds ability to get triton
* dungeons_enhanced:tall_witch_hut
* dungeons_enhanced:tower_of_the_undead
* dungeons_enhanced:watch_tower
* dungeons_enhanced:witch_tower

grindstone is getting removed, but dungeon loot will be allowed to have enchantments. enchantments will be sort of a "lost art". 

only runes will be allowed to be found. no enchanted books (you can read them which doesnt follow the lore)

gemstones can be found in:
* cut emerald : diorite
* cut diamond: gabbro
* cut amethyst: dolomite, claystone
* cut lapis: marble, limestone
* cut opal: quartzite
* cut pyrite: phyllite, basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, shist, slate
* cut ruby: chert
* cut sapphire: chalk
* cut topaz:granite
